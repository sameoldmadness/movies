The Challenge
=============

The dataset below contains locations of filming in movies in the San Francisco Bay Area.

* title
* release year
* location
* fun facts
* production company
* distributor
* director
* writer
* actor 1

Could you think of an interesting, interactive experience around that data?

For bonus points, feel free to use an external data source that outlines other interesting aspects related to this dataset (i.e, SF Geographical Boundaries, Movie Ratings, Box Office Numbers or whatever you find interesting).

When done, please send a Github/Bitbucket link and hosted app link. We will then review and find a day where you can present the code, followed by a technical interview.
