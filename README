The Challenge
=============

The dataset below contains locations of filming in movies in the San Francisco Bay Area.

* title
* release year
* location
* fun facts
* production company
* distributor
* director
* writer
* actor 1
* actor 2
* actor 3

Could you think of an interesting, interactive experience around that data?

For bonus points, feel free to use an external data source that outlines other interesting aspects related to this dataset (i.e, SF Geographical Boundaries, Movie Ratings, Box Office Numbers or whatever you find interesting).

When done, please send a Github/Bitbucket link and hosted app link. We will then review and find a day where you can present the code, followed by a technical interview.  

Ideas
-----

External datasources:

* IMDB for movie rating
* Yandex.Maps for coordinates
* tumblr for related images
* twitter for related tweets

Visualisations:

* place location pins on a map
* spread movies across a timeline
* provide slices by director/actor/whatever
* fix spellings
* augmented reality on google.panorams

Mockup
------

* choose movie
* movie card: photo, info, places,
* places lead to panoramas

TODO
----

deploy
get data from source
agressive caching
sw
pre-geocode and get coordinates
auto-zoom the map
draw bars (num of movies per year) above the range
movie label on pin
movie card on click
refactor to components
web-components
optimize from mobile
